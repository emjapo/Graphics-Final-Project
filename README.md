Project 3 in the Fall 2021 CSCI 440 course:  Putting it All Together.

Please implement a *WebGL* program using (at least) your two objects from Project 2.  Your program should be animated and interactive.  Moreover, it must include all of the following elements:
*  Camera view and perspective projection transformations.
*  Lighting and shading.
*  Texturing applied to at least one of your 3D objects.
*  Controls to move the camera around the scene by rotating around the *z*-axis and $y$-axis.
*  Animation:  At least one of your objects should move (on its own) around the scene

## A Few Hints
* It might be useful to start with my *ThreeDimObj* class from the Week 11 example.
* But my texture coordinate routine will need some work to map onto complex shapes.
* Remember to pick textures that have dimensions that are a power of two.
* You don't need my camera view matrix routine ... remember *lookAt()*.
* *Start Early*!!  This will not be an easy project
